"""Kernel-side transport verification for organ bridge messages.

Third mirror of the DALEOBANKS/WealthMachineIntelligence bridge security
module (services/bridge_security.py and src/services/bridge_security.py at
the commits recorded in organs/*.manifest.yaml) — keep the canonical form,
header names, and verification semantics field-for-field compatible.

Kernel extension: "kernel" joins the known-identity set so the kernel can
witness and later participate in bridge traffic. The peer repositories
still list only {daleobanks, wealthmachine}; until they add "kernel",
messages SIGNED BY the kernel are not verifiable by the organs. That gap
is recorded as an unresolved field in both peer manifests — it is a
cross-repository change, not something this module may paper over.

A valid signature proves sender authenticity ONLY. It never carries
authorization: a perfectly signed payload still has no execution authority
and still routes through the consequence gate and human approval.

#: Explicit opt-in to the legacy unsigned path. Set to "1" to allow it.

#: Added 2026-08-22 under FOUNDER-RULING-2026-08-22, which ratified asymmetric
#: workload identity and ruled on what may remain of the shared-key transport:
#: *"If legacy HMAC compatibility must temporarily survive, it must be an
#: explicit development compatibility mode, fail closed, never auto-downgrade,
#: and never be mistaken for mutually isolated identity."*
#:
#: It previously auto-downgraded. `must_sign` was derived as `bool(key)`, so an
#: unset `WEALTHMACHINE_SIGNING_KEY` did not fail — it returned SUCCESS carrying
#: the caller's *claimed* identity, unverified. Absence of configuration
#: silently disabled authentication, which is the failure mode where a forgotten
#: environment variable in a new deployment reads as a working trust boundary.
#: Now the absence of a key is refused unless a human has explicitly asked for
#: the legacy path by name.
