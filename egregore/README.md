# ADE-1 standing cognition

This package implements the useful core of the ADE-1 blueprint as a bounded
UNIIMENTE organ. It is continuously schedulable, restartable, evidence-bound,
resource-bounded, and capable of multi-organ deliberation. It is not a legal
person, sovereign actor, autonomous treasurer, or self-preserving process.

The invariant is simple:

> Standing cognition may produce a candidate. Only the kernel Consequence Gate
> may turn a bound proposal into an external effect.

## What is implemented

- Content-addressed telemetry envelopes with duplicate suppression and
  contradiction retention.
- Idempotent cognition ticks that rebuild from the Evidence Ledger.
- Deterministic proposer/evaluator deliberation with required Guardian and
  Treasury assessments, explicit vetoes, preserved dissent, and isolated organ
  failure.
- Hard model-call and estimated-cost ceilings with conservation and hibernation.
- An unconditional suspend path and hash-authorized resume path.
- Immutable self-change proposals with tests and rollback declarations, but no
  self-apply function.
- A narrow adapter into the existing `policy.engine.Proposal` and
  `ConsequenceGate.run` path.
- Five-closure checks, an output schema, and adversarial unit tests.

## What is intentionally absent

- Private keys, wallet signing, swaps, transfers, staking, or treasury control.
- Direct social publishing or external API execution.
- A legal principal named UNIIMENTE.
- Attention-driven permission or budget expansion.
- Automatic prompt, policy, model, code, or infrastructure mutation.
- Claims of consciousness, life, sovereign intent, or cryptographic truth.

## Scheduler integration

Temporal, cron, a block trigger, or another durable scheduler can call `tick`.
The scheduler must supply a globally stable `trigger_id`; retrying that ID with
the same inputs returns the recorded cycle, while changing the inputs under the
same ID is retained as a conflict and refused.

```python
cycle = runtime.tick(
    trigger_id="temporal:ade1:2026-07-22T12:00Z",
    signal_ids=signal_ids,
    resources=ResourceGovernor(
        max_model_calls=12,
        max_estimated_cost_usd=0.25,
    ),
    call_costs={
        "proposer:strategist": 0.04,
        "evaluator:guardian": 0.02,
        "evaluator:treasury": 0.01,
    },
)
```

The runtime stops at `cycle.selected_candidate_id`. A separate, explicitly
accountable service may bind that candidate to a real machine passport and
legal principal with `bind_for_gate`, then call `submit_through_gate`. No other
effect path belongs in this package.

## Active inference boundary

This release does not label multi-agent voting as active inference. A future
active-inference organ must declare a generative probabilistic model, latent
states, observations, preferences, posterior approximation, and a testable
free-energy objective. Until then, this implementation is accurately described
as bounded deliberation.
